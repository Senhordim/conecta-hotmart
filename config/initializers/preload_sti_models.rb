  Child classes are not recognized by the parent until they are loaded.
  In typical Rails production and test environments this happens right
  away, but in development, where config.cache_classes == false,
  classes arenâ€™t loaded until you call upon them. So, for this to work
  consistently in our development environment we need to manually
  require classes.
